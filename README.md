# Vidverse

Vidverse is a simple web application that allows you to watch a curated collection of videos. The project is built using HTML and CSS, and it does not support user-uploaded videos. Instead, it offers a collection of YouTube videos that you can watch by clicking on the thumbnails.

# Getting Started

To get started, simply open the https://musman12529.github.io/Vidverse-Youtube-clone/ file in your browser. <br>
This will load the Vidverse web application and display a grid of video thumbnails with their corresponding titles.

# Features

Video Thumbnails: The main page of Vidverse displays a grid of video thumbnails along with their titles. Each thumbnail represents a video available for viewing.<br>

Video Playback: Clicking on a video thumbnail will open the corresponding YouTube video in a new tab. The web application provides a curated collection of interesting videos for you to enjoy.

# Usage
    
Open the https://musman12529.github.io/Vidverse-Youtube-clone/ file in your web browser.<br>
Browse through the video thumbnails and titles.<br>
Click on a thumbnail to open the corresponding YouTube video in a new tab.<br>

Please note that Vidverse does not support user uploads, and it only allows you to watch the pre-selected videos provided in the HTML code.<br>

# Contributing

As this project is a simple demonstration of HTML and CSS usage, it is not actively looking for contributions. However, you are free to fork the project and modify it to suit your needs or create your own version.

# Acknowledgments

The project was inspired by the idea of creating a simple video player using only HTML and CSS.<br>
Thumbnail images and video titles are for demonstration purposes only and are sourced from YouTube.
